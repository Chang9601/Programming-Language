## Quiz Questions

1. Draw a picture of the Von Neumann Architecture.  
생략(skip)

2) What architecture component connects the memory to the CPU?  
버스(Bus)

3) Where are programs stored when the computer is turned off?  
보조기억 장치(Secondary Storage)

4) Where must programs be located when they are executing?  
주기억 장치(RAM)

5) How does cache memory help overall performance?  
데이터를 캐시에 저장해서 버스를 통해서 RAM에서 가져올 필요없이 더 빠르게 데이터에 접근 가능(Cache memory boost overall performance because RAM can fetch data from cache memory instead of using bus to retrieve it.)

6) How many bytes does a C++ integer declared with the declaration int use?  
4 바이트(4 bytes,double-word)

7) On the Intel X86-64 architecture, how many bytes can be stored at each address?  
1바이트(1byte)

8) Given the 32-bit hex 004C4B40(16) what is the:  
최하위 비트(LSB):40   
최상위 비트(MSB):00

9) Given the 32-bit hex 004C4B40(16), show the little-endian memory layout showing each byte in memory.  
(낮은 주소,low address) 40 4B 4C 00 (높은 주소,high address)

10) Draw a picture of the layout for the rax register.  
생략(skip)

11) How many bits does each of the following represent:  
al:8 비트(8 bits)     
rcx:64 비트(64 bits)  
bx:16 비트(16 bits)  
edx:32 비트(32 bits)  
r11:64 비트(64 bits)  
r8b:8 비트(8 bits)  
sil:8 비트(8 bits)  
r14w:16 비트(16 bits)  

12) Which register points to the next instruction to be executed?  
rip 레지스터(rip register)

13) Which register points to the current top of the stack?  
rsp 레지스터(rsp register)

14) If al is set to 05(16) and ax is set to 0007(16), eax is set to 00000020(16), and rax is set to 0000000000000000(16), and show the final complete contents of the complete rax register.  
0000000000000020(내답,my answer) -> **000000000000000000(정답,correct answer)**

15) If the rax register is set to 81,985,529,216,486,89510 (123456789ABCDEF(16))
what are the contents of the following registers in hex?  
al:EF(16)  
ax:CDEF(16)  
eax:89ABCDEF(16)  
rax:0123456789ABCDEF(16)
